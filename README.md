**A note to contributors about donations** to Goot Proper released by the company Eski:
The GitHub Project and the released app in the Google Play Store by Eski are two separate entities.  Goot Proper intends to make use of a large majority of the open source project Goot.  Donations to Goot Proper will be managed by the independent developer David Breneisen.  At the end of the calendar year donation amounts will be accounted for on Goot's original GitHub Repository.  50% of all donations after the transaction fee is applied will then be donated to Project Gutenberg, which maintains the server hosting the books.  All other usages of donations will be accounted for in the end of year report.

Since Goot is an open source project under the apache 2.0 license, there is no problem with forking a copy and modifying it to any extent.  Commercial usage is also allowed, however simply copying it and republishing it in order to profit would be in rather bad taste.
